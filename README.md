## INTRODUCTION
This is a **Power BI** project on **Analysis and Visualization on Energy Consumed in Brazil**. The derived insights is to answer crusial questions and help make data driven decisions.

_**Disclaimer**_: All the datasets and reports are fictitious and do not represent any person, institution, country or person, but a dummy dataset to demostrate my **skills** and **capabilities** on Power BI. ðŸ˜ƒ

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To analyse and visualise
1. Find the total energy consumed 
    - For each year
    - Total for all year 

2. Find the lowest energy consumed in a month by year and the highest energy consumed in a month by year

2. Find the lowest energy consumed in a day, in a year and highest energy consumed in a day, in a year.  

## DATA QUAITY REPORT
Data quality reporting is the process I used in removing and reorganising all compromising data.

## DATA TRANSFORMATION
Data cleaning and transformation was carried out using **Power BI** Query. 
1. _Data in the table are not from the same period; only a month data for 2023 was recorded in the dataset_ **###Cleaning** the one (1) month record for 2023 was removed in other not to skew the data. 
2. _The Index Column was not in the appropriate data type **Cleaning*** The Index data type was changed to date and Hourly, Number. 
3. _Inconsist decimal place_ **Cleaning** all values was rounded up to an whole number. 


## DATA MODELING 
No modeling was required since its just a table
